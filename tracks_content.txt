Track listing
CD1 Track 1
Introduction
CD1 Track 2
Words ending in ‘-ible’ and ‘-able’ in English (e.g. ‘possible’, ‘probable’) are
similar in Portuguese. The Portuguese ending is -ível or -ável, with the stress
on the í or á: ‘possible’ = possível. The unstressed o sounds almost like the
English ‘oo’.
Pronunciation of rr: horrível = ‘horrible’; terrível = ‘terrible’
confortável = ‘comfortable’; provável = ‘probable’; aceitável = ‘acceptable’
é = ‘is’ or ‘it is’
CD1 Track 3
para = ‘for’ as in ‘for me’; unstressed a sounds like the ‘a’ in the English
name ‘Linda’
para mim = ‘for me’. The m at the end of a word indicates that it is a nasal
sound (pronounced through the nose).
o senhor = ‘you’ (speaking to a man); a senhora = ‘you’ (speaking to a
woman). (There is a less formal form você, but you need to know when it is
appropriate to use it; we will use o senhor / a senhora in this course.)
CD1 Track 4
não ‘not’ and ‘no’ (ã is also a nasal sound). Não goes before é to mean
‘not it is = it is not’: não é possível ‘not it is possible = it is not possible’.
To ask a question, just raise your voice at the end: É possível? = ‘It is
possible? = Is it possible?’
CD1 Track 5
porque? (literally ‘for what?’) = ‘Why?’ Portuguese-speakers often add é que
= ‘is it that’ after a question word: Porque é que não é aceitável para o

senhor? = ‘For what is it that not it is acceptable for you? = Why isn’t it
acceptable for you?’
assim = ‘like that’, ‘that way’
CD1 Track 6
lamento, literally ‘I lament’ = ‘I’m sorry’ – the o at the end of lamento
indicates the verb ending for ‘I’. eu = ‘I’, but you only need to use this if you
want to emphasise who is doing the action.
desculpe = ‘excuse (me)’
mas = ‘but’. The final -s will sound differently depending on what follows it.
It sounds like the ‘s’ of the English ‘measure’ when the following word starts
with a consonant (e.g. mas não é = ‘but it is not’).
sim = ‘yes’
Words ending in ‘-ent’ and ‘-ant’ in English (e.g. ‘different’, ‘important’) are
similar in Portuguese. The Portuguese ending is -ente or -ante. Portuguese
words only have one stressed syllable per word. Words ending in a vowel
are usually stressed on the syllable before last, so on the a of importante:
importante = ‘important’.
diferente = ‘different’
restaurante = ‘restaurant’. The s here sounds like the English ‘sh’ because
it’s in front of t.
Pronunciation of an unstressed e: skate over it.
CD1 Track 7
bom (masculine thing), boa (feminine thing) = ‘good’
muito = ‘very’
Pronunciation of s: the s of mas sounds like English ‘z’ when the following
word starts with a vowel (e.g. mas é = ‘but it is’).
tenho = ‘I have’
Pronunciation of nh: sounds like English ‘ny’.
tenho-o = ‘I have it’; quero-o = ‘I want it’

agora = ‘now’
Position of ‘it’ in the negative: não o tenho = ‘not it I have = I don’t have it’.
constante = ‘constant’; evidente = ‘evident’; urgente = ‘urgent’:
pronunciation of g and ur.
CD1 Track 8
porque = ‘because’
tem = ‘you have’
o que (literally ‘the what’) = ‘what’. In this case also, Portuguese-speakers
often add é que: O que é que tem? = ‘The what is it that you have? = What
do you have?’
o used for masculine things; a for feminine things; o / a = both ‘the’ and ‘it’
tem-no = ‘you have it’. When you add ‘it’ to ‘you have’ you add an n to o /
a to make it easier to say after the nasal sound of tem: tem-no / tem-na.
Position of ‘it’ with porque: before verb (like with não and question words):
porque (eu) o / a quero = ‘because (I) it I want = because I want it’;
Porque (é que) o / a tem? = ‘Why (is it that) it you have? = Why do you
have it?’
CD1 Track 9
quer = ‘you want’. To make it easier to say, an e is added at the end in ‘you
want it’ = quere-o / a, but you skate over it.
CD1 Track 10
saber = ‘to know’. In Portuguese, the ‘to’ form, the whole verb, ends in r
and, therefore, is always stressed on the ending.
quero saber = ‘I want to know’; não quero saber = ‘not I want to know = I
don’t want to know’
posso = ‘I can’
pode = ‘you can’. Pronunciation: stress the o, skate over the e. In
Portuguese, the stress in the present tense is on the syllable before last.

fazer = ‘to do’; o que posso fazer? = ‘The what I can to do? = What can
I do?’
CD1 Track 11
hoje = ‘today’
algo = ‘something’
CD1 Track 12
comer = ‘to eat’. Pronunciation of the r.
tenho fome = ‘I have hunger = I am hungry’; tem fome = ‘you are hungry’
Pronunciation of the o: when stressed should sound like the ‘o’ of English
‘not’, and when not stressed should sound almost like the English ‘oo’, as in
‘food’.
CD2 Track 1
English words ending in ‘-ary’ end in -ário in Portuguese: ‘necessary’ =
necessário; ‘contrary’ = contrário; ‘vocabulary’ = vocabulário. Portuguese u
sounds like English ‘oo’, not like ‘yew’.
preciso de (literally ‘I precise of’) = ‘I need’. With preciso de, if you want to
say ‘I need it’, the ‘it’ will not be o / a but dele (for a masculine thing) and
dela (for a feminine thing). Dele / dela = de (‘of’) + ele / ela (‘he / she’ or
‘it’).
não preciso dele = ‘I don’t need it’. Although we have não, ‘it’ doesn’t go
before the verb, because the Portuguese is ‘need of it’.
e = ‘and’
CD2 Track 2
ver = ‘to see’
vê-lo / vê-la = ‘to see it’. When you attach the ‘it’ to the ‘to’ form of the
verb, it drops the final r and the o / a turns into lo / la to make it easier
to say.
não o quero ver (= ‘not it I want to see’) means the same as não quero vêlo = ‘not I want to see it = I don’t want to see it’. If there are two or more

13

consecutive verbs in a sentence, the second and subsequent verbs will be in
the full form (the ‘to’ form in English): quero ver = ‘I want to see’.
fazê-lo / fazê-la = ‘to do it’
CD2 Track 3
Words in English ending in ‘-ence’ and ‘-ance’ end in -ência (-ença) and
-ância in Portuguese: ‘influence’ = influência; ‘preference’ = preferência;
‘difference’ = diferença; ‘importance’ = importância.
Most words ending with the letter -a are feminine and most words ending
with the letter -o are masculine.
a diferença = ‘the difference’; uma diferença = ‘a difference’
que = ‘what’: Que preferência tem? = ‘What preference do you have?’ Tem
preferência? = ‘Do you have a preference?’ (no ‘a’ in Portuguese)
por que = ‘for what’: Por que restaurante tem preferência? = ‘For what
restaurant do you have a preference?’
esta noite = ‘this night = tonight’
CD2 Track 4
onde = ‘where’
jantar = ‘to dine = to have dinner’
Words ending in ‘-tion’ in English end in -ção in Portuguese: ‘condition’ =
condição; ‘nation’ = nação; ‘situation’ = situação; ‘organization’ =
organização. The ç of -ção sounds like ‘s’, not ‘k’. The -ção ending is always
stressed in Portuguese.
Pronunciation: single -s- between two vowels sounds like a ‘z’: posição =
‘position’
One English ‘-tion’ word that does not end in -ção in Portuguese:
‘reservation’ = reserva
For feminine things: a = ‘the’; uma = ‘a’; for masculine things:
o = ‘the’; um = ‘a’
CD2 Track 5
de = ‘of’; do / da = ‘of the’, from = de (‘of’) + o / a (= ‘the’): da reserva =
‘of the reservation’. For the plural just add s.

MTM Foundation Portuguese

Page 15

dum / duma = de (‘of’) + um / uma (= ‘a’) = ‘of a’: duma reserva = ‘of a
reservation’. When you add s to make the plural, the sense is ‘some’.
confirmação = ‘confirmation’: Pronunciation of ir: pronounce the i and the r
separately. ir in Portuguese does not sound like ‘ir’ in English.
tipo = ‘kind / type’: que tipo de = ‘what type of’
CD2 Track 6
There are some ‘-tion’ words that end in -ção but are slightly different from
the English: ‘translation’ = tradução; ‘explanation’ = explicação. Most words
that end in ‘-ion’ in English and in -ção in Portuguese are feminine words,
for which ‘the’ is a.
Polite requests: pode…? = ‘can you…? = will you…?’: Pode fazer uma
tradução para mim? = ‘You can to do a translation for me? = Will you do a
translation for me?’
por favor = ‘for favour = please’
Pronunciation of x.
dar = ‘to give’
CD2 Track 7
Verbs that come from nouns that are similar in English and Portuguese (e.g.
‘formation’ = formação) will also be similar in the two languages. To make
the verb in Portuguese, you just add -ar to the English verb: ‘to form’ =
formar; ‘to confirm’ = confirmar.
The whole form of a verb, the infinitive, is expressed with ‘to’ in English (for
example, ‘to eat’). In Portuguese, it is expressed in an ending. There are
four endings: -ar (falar = ‘to speak’), -er (comer = ‘to eat’), -ir (sair = ‘to
leave / to go out’) and -or (pôr = ‘to put’).
impressão = ‘impression’
CD2 Track 8
aqui = ‘here’. Like assim, aqui is stressed on the last syllable because
Portuguese words with i or u in the last syllable are stressed on that last

syllable. Words ending in -l are also stressed on the last syllable: Portugal;
Brasil; Funchal; Miguel.
Words that end in -r, -l, -i or have i or u in the last syllable and are not
stressed on that last syllable have a written accent to show where the stress
goes: possível; provável.
Pronunciation of ss: like English ‘s’.
Plural of ‘it’: os / as = ‘them’; vê-los / vê-las = ‘to see them’
o (masculine) and a (feminine) not only means ‘the’ and ‘it’ in English but
also can be used to refer to o senhor / a senhora. So, ‘to see you (‘you’ = o
senhor / a senhora)’ is vê-lo / vê-la. For the plural just add s.
me = ‘me’: ver-me = ‘to see me’
CD2 Track 9
compreender = ‘to understand’
dizer = ‘to say’, ‘to tell’
lhe (same form for masculine and feminine) = ‘(to) you’: dizer-lhe = ‘to tell
you’
Pronunciation of lh: similar to English y
pode dizer-me and pode me dizer (= ‘will you tell me’) are both correct; the
second is more common.

isto = ‘this’ (in general)
comprar = ‘to buy’

caro (masculine thing), cara (feminine thing) = ‘expensive’: é muito caro =
‘it is very expensive’
ter = ‘to have’

CD3 Track 3
In English ‘to have to’ has the same meaning as ‘must’. In Portuguese to
express that meaning you add de to ter: ter de = ‘to have of = must’; tenho
de = ‘I have to / I must’; tenho de o fazer = ‘I have of it to do = I have to
do it’; tem de = ‘you have to’, ‘you must’
daqui a pouco = ‘from here to little = soon’
quando? = ‘when?’: Quando tem de sair? = ‘When do you have to go out?’
CD3 Track 4
Words ending in ‘-ical’ and ‘-ic’ in English end in -ico in Portuguese:
‘political’ = político; ‘economic’ = económico; ‘logical’ = lógico; ‘practical’ =
prático.
Portuguese words ending in a, e or o and m or s are stressed on the
syllable before last; if not, they have a written accent (e.g. José, Canadá).
CD3 Track 5
In Portuguese to say ‘the political situation’ you invert the order and say ‘the
situation political’: a situação política. The word político changes to política
because situação is a feminine word.
Words ending in ‘-ty’ in English end in -dade in Portuguese and are all
feminine words: ‘university’ = universidade; ‘city’ = cidade; ‘society’ =
sociedade.
em = ‘in’; em Portugal = ‘in Portugal’. In Portuguese, ‘the’ is used in front of
the names of most countries (Portugal is one exception): a Itália (feminine
word) ; o Brasil (masculine word).
no = em (‘in’) + o (‘the’) = ‘in (the)’: no Brasil; na = em (‘in’) + a (‘the’) =
‘in (the)’: na Itália
CD3 Track 6
quanto? = ‘how much?’: É quanto? = Quanto é? = ‘How much is it?’
se = ‘if’: se possível = ‘if possible’; se não é muito caro = ‘if it is not very
expensive’
estou = ‘I am’

está =‘you are’
casa =‘house’: esta casa = ‘this house’
estar =‘to be’
como =‘how’: Como está? = ‘How are you?’
dia (masculine word) = ‘day’: bom dia = ‘good day’, ‘hello’
CD3 Track 8
vou = ‘I am going’: vou estar = ‘I am going to be’
não vou comprá-lo / comprá-la = não o / a vou comprar = ‘I am not going
to buy it’
CD3 Track 9
tarde = ‘late’;
mais ou menos = ‘more or less’
mais tarde = ‘more late = later’
tarde (feminine word) = ‘afternoon’, ‘evening’: boa tarde = ‘good afternoon
/ evening’
CD3 Track 10
ligar = ‘to call’, ‘to ring’: ligar-lhe = ‘to call to you = to call you’
a = ‘at’; hora = ‘hour’: a que horas? = ‘at what hours? = at what time?’
CD4 Track 1
For all verbs, in Portuguese, the form for ‘you’ is the same as for ‘he / she /
it’: vai = ‘you are going to to’ and ‘he / she / it is going to’. Use a clarifier if
it is not clear whom you are talking about or if you want to add emphasis:
ele (he), ela (she) or o senhor / a senhora (you) to make it clear: ela vai

MTM Foundation Portuguese

5/6/08

Page 19

fazê-lo = ‘she is going to do it’; ele vai fazê-lo = ‘he is going to do it’;
o senhor vai fazê-lo = ‘you are going to do it’; a senhora vai fazê-lo =
‘you are going to do it’.
Pronunciation of ele and ela: initial e pronounced differently because the
following vowel affects the way the first one is pronounced.
CD4 Track 2
pronto / pronta = ‘ready’
tudo = ‘all’, ‘everything’
amanhã = ‘tomorrow’
Word order: Tudo vai estar pronto amanhã (‘all is going to be ready
tomorrow’) = Vai estar tudo pronto amanhã (‘it is going to be all ready
tomorrow’). No difference in meaning; both ways are correct.
CD4 Track 3
In Portuguese, there are two verbs for ‘to be’: estar (estou; está) and ser
(é). Estar expresses a temporary attribute of something: está pronto = ‘it is
ready’. Ser expresses a permanent characteristic: é possível = ‘it is possible’.
Estar expresses ‘to be’ at the moment, in the short term: how something is,
where something is: something’s current state. (One of the meanings of the
Portuguese word estado is ‘state’: Os Estados Unidos do Brasil = ‘The
United States of Brazil’.) The verb ser expresses the characteristics of what
something is and one meaning of the word ser is ‘being’ (as in ‘human
being’): o ser humano = ‘the human being’.
sou = ‘I am’
inglês (masculine form and also the name of the language) / inglesa
(feminine form) = ‘English’; português / portuguesa = ‘Portuguese’
As a rule first names in Portuguese are preceded by ‘the’: o Paulo = the
Paulo = ‘Paulo’; a Maria = the Maria = ‘Maria’.
sei = ‘I know’

doente = ‘ill’
bonito / bonita = ‘pretty’
preparação = ‘preparation’; preparar = ‘to prepare’
Muito also means ‘much’ or ‘very much’. To say ‘thank you’ in Portuguese
you say that you are ‘obliged’ = obrigado / obrigada: muito obrigado (if
you are a man) / muito obrigada (if you are a woman) = ‘thank you very
much’.
CD4 Track 5
Revision of verbs
com = ‘with’: com o senhor / a senhora = ‘with you’ ; com ele / ela = ‘with
him / her’
comigo = ‘with me’
vir = ‘to come’
CD4 Track 6
ir = ‘to go’
Stress in the present tense is on the syllable before last (the penultimate
syllable). If there are only two syllables, you stress the first syllable. For ‘I’,
you push down on the syllable before last and usually surface on the letter
-o (pronounced ‘oo’). Take off the ending (-ar, -er, -ir) of the ‘to’ form of the
verb (the whole verb / the infinitive) and replace it with an -o: preparar:
preparo = ‘I prepare’; comprar: compro = ‘I buy’; falar: falo = ‘I speak’;
compreender: compreendo = ‘I understand’; vender = ‘to sell’; vendo = ‘I
sell’.
Only a few verbs do not surface on -o for the ‘I’ form: ser: sou = ‘I am’;
estar: estou = ‘I am’; ir: vou = ‘I go’; dar: dou = ‘I give’ and saber: sei = ‘I
know’.
CD4 Track 7
Revision of o / a
compro-o covers all the senses ‘I buy it / I am buying it / I do buy it’.

escrever = ‘to write’; escrevo = ‘I write’
todos os dias = all the days = ‘everyday’; pronunciation of s
For the ‘you / he / she / it’ form in the present tense of the -ar verbs you
push down on the syllable before last and surface on the letter -a: comprar:
compra = ‘you / he / she / it buys’; preparar: prepara = ‘you / he / she / it
prepares’; falar: fala = ‘you / he / she / it speaks’;
For the ‘you / he / she / it’ form of the not -ar verbs you push down on the
syllable before last and surface on the letter -e: vender: vende = ‘you / he /
she / it sells’; compreender: compreende = ‘you / he / she / it understands’;
escrever: escreve = ‘you / he / she / it sells’; partir: parte = ‘you / he / she /
it leaves’.
CD4 Track 9
saber: sabe = ‘you / he / she / it knows’
Through over-use some verbs in the -er group have dropped the -e at the
end of the ‘you / he / she / it’ form: fazer: faz = ‘you / he / she / it does’;
querer: quer = ‘you / he / she / it wants’; ter: tem = ‘you / he / she / it has’.
sair: sai = ‘you / he / she / it leaves’; vai = ‘you / he / she / it go’
CD5 Track 1
The Portuguese ‘-ing’ tense expresses what you are in the process of doing
right now. To form it you use estar (‘to be’ in the present tense) + a (‘at’) +
the ‘to’ form of the verb: estou a sair = ‘I am (in the process of) going out’;
estou a escrever = ‘I am (in the process of) writing’; O que está a fazer? =
‘What are you doing?’
diz = ‘you / he / she / it says’
querer dizer = ‘to want to say’ and ‘to mean’: O que (o senhor / a
senhora) quer dizer? = ‘What do you want to say?’, ‘What do you mean?’
isto = ‘this’: O que quer dizer isto? = ‘The what means this? = What does
this mean?’

CD5 Track 3
quem? = ‘who?’: Quem pode fazê-lo? = ‘Who can do it?’
toda a gente = all the people = ‘everyone’, ‘everybody’
gostar de = ‘to like (of)’ (o unstressed, so pronounced ‘oo’); gosto de = ‘I
like (of)’ (first o stressed, so pronounced like ‘o’ of ‘not’); gosto dele / dela
= ‘I like it / him / her’ ; gosto de vê-lo / vê-la = ‘I like of to see you / it /
him / her = I like to see you / it / him / her’; gosto = ‘I like’: gosto muito =
‘I like very much = I like it very much’; gosto muito de escrever = ‘I like very
much to write’; gosta? = ‘do you like?’; Gosta de escrever? = ‘Do you like
to write?’
CD5 Track 4
For the ‘they’ (and ‘you all’) form of verbs in the present, you just add an
-m (the m makes it a nasal sound) after the -a or -e of ‘you / he / she / it’
depending on which track you are on: fala: falam = ‘they speak’; compra:
compram = ‘they buy’; pode: podem = ‘they can’; compreende:
compreendem = ‘they understand’; sabe: sabem = ‘they know’.
CD5 Track 5
With the not -ar verbs that lost their -e ending, you add back the -e before
adding the -m to show ‘they / you all’: faz: fazem = ‘they do / make’; diz:
dizem = ‘they say’. Pronunciation of the z.
quer: querem = ‘they / you want’
sai: saiem = ‘they / you leave’
tem: têm = ‘they / you have’
Because the ‘they / you all’ form ends with -m, the o / a or os / as for ‘it /
them / you’ changes to no / na / nos / nas: fazem-no (‘they are doing it’);
vendem-nas (‘they are selling them’).

CD5 Track 6
Revision of present tense
CD5 Track 7
There are several words for ‘you’ in Portuguese. With friends and family
members, Portuguese speakers use the informal form: tu. In the present
tense, to obtain the tu form you add an -s to the ‘you (formal) / he / she /
it’ form (just as you did with the -m for the ‘they’ form): fala: falas = ‘you
speak’; está: estás = ‘you are’; vende: vendes = ‘you sell’; compreende:
compreendes = ‘you sell’; faz: fazes = ‘you do’.
este (for masculine things) / esta (for feminine things) = ‘this’: este livro =
‘this book’; esta casa = ‘this house’. For the plural you just add -s: estes /
estas = ‘these’.
CD5 Track 8
If you switch tracks in the present tense (from -a to -e or from -e to -a), that
gives you the imperative (the command tense): compra: compre! = ‘buy!’;
vende: venda! = ‘sell!’; vendem: vendam! = ‘sell! (addressing a a group);
falam: falem! = ‘speak!’(addressing a group).
With tu (the informal ‘you’, for addressing Roberto / Roberta) this also
applies but only in ‘negative’ commands: não vendes = ‘you don’t sell’; não
vendas! = ‘don’t sell!’. For the ‘positive’ commands you drop the s: vendes
= ‘you sell’; vende! = ‘sell!’
If you use the positive command with a pronoun (e.g. ‘me’, ‘him’, ‘it’,
‘them’), hook the pronoun onto the end of the verb. If the verb ends in -m
then you add an n to the pronoun: vendam-nas! = ‘sell them!’ (talking
about several feminine things).
CD5 Track 9
For the ‘we’ form of the verb in the present tense: drop the -r of the ‘to’
form, the whole verb, and add -mos: falar: falamos = ‘we speak’; comer:
comemos = ‘we eat’; sair: saímos = ‘we leave’.
vir: vimos = ‘we come’; vender: vendemos = ‘we sell’; escrever: escrevemos
= ‘we write’; ter: temos = ‘we have’; fazer: fazemos = ‘we do / make’.

Page 24

If the ‘we’ form is followed by a pronoun (e.g. ‘me’, ‘him’, ‘it’, ‘them’), the s
of -mos is dropped and we put an l in front of the o / a or os / as, to make
it easier to say: fazemo-lo = ‘we do it’.
CD5 Track 10
The verb ir (=‘to go’) is a bit special and the ‘we’ and ‘they / you all’ forms
don’t exactly follow the rule: vamos = ‘we go’; vão = ‘they / you go’.
chegar = ‘to arrive’; chegadas = ‘arrivals’
Lisboa = ‘Lisbon’: chegar a Lisboa = ‘to arrive in Lisbon’
CD5 Track 11
pôr (‘to put’) is the one verb that forms the family of verbs that ends in -or.
The -or verbs, the fourth group, is very small. It comprises pôr and all the
verbs formed with it, that is, verbs that end with -por in Portuguese and that
in English end with ‘-pose’: opor = ‘to oppose’; supor = ‘to suppose’;
compor = ‘to compose’.
ponho = ‘I put’; suponho = ‘I suppose’
CD6 Track 1
The -zer verbs: fazer = ‘to do’; dizer = ‘to say’; trazer = ‘to bring’. In the ‘I’
form in the present tense they also end in o but there is a change of
consonant: fazer: faço = ‘I do’; dizer: digo = ‘I say’; trazer: trago = ‘I bring’.
For this reason we call them the ço-go verbs.
digo-lhe = ‘I am telling you / I tell him / her’.
trago-o = ‘I am bringing it’, but the o can also refer to a person, ‘I am
bringing him’.
traz = ‘you / he / she / it brings’; trazem = ‘they bring’, ‘you bring’
(addressing several people)
Informal ‘you’ form (tu): dizes = ‘you say’; trazes = ‘you bring’
dizemos = ‘we say’; trazemos = ‘we bring’

CD6 Track 2
Verbs ending in -nho in the ‘I’ form of the present tense change to -nha in
the command tense: ponho: ponha! = ‘put!’; tenho: tenha…! = ‘have…!’;
venho: venha! = ‘come!’. The same applies if addressing a a group (‘you all’).
To avoid the command tense you can always use the structure: pode +
whole verb, the ‘to’ form: Pode pô-lo aqui, por favor? = ‘Can / will you put
it here, please?’
CD6 Track 3
The -zer verbs (ço-go verbs) also change from -o to -a in the command
tense for the singular ‘you’ (o senhor / a senhora) and plural ‘you’ (= ‘you
all’). You take the ‘I’ form of the present tense and change the final -o to -a:
digo: diga! = ‘say it!’; faço: faça! = ‘do it!’; trago: traga…! = ‘bring…!’ So
the ço-go verbs change to ça-ga in the command tense.
diga-me! = ‘tell me!’; não me diga! = ‘don’t tell me!’; diga-o em português!
= ‘Say it in Portuguese!’; diga-lhe! = ‘tell him / her!’
tragam-no! = ‘bring it!’ (addressing a a group); não o tragam! = ‘don’t
bring it1’
não o faças! = ‘don’t do it!’ (addressing Roberto / Roberta = tu form)
CD6 Track 4
ligue-me! = ‘call me!’; não me ligues! = ‘don’t call me!’ (addressing Roberto
/ Roberta)
não me digas! = ‘don’t tell me!’ (addressing Roberto / Roberta)
There is only one case when you don’t switch tracks in the command tense:
when you give a positive command in the tu form. You don’t switch tracks
and you don’t add s; you actually use a form which is exactly the same as
the ‘you (formal) / he / she / it’ form of the present tense: liga-me! = ‘call

CD6 Track 9
vou levantar-me = ‘I am going to get up’; tenho de levantar-me = ‘I have to
get up’
vamos levantar-nos = ‘we are going to get up’; temos de levantar-nos =
‘we have to get up’
tem de se levantar = tem de levantar-se = ‘he / she has to / you have to
get up’
levantar-se is also the ‘to’ form (the infinitive) of the verb

CD6 Track 10
ficar = ‘to be’, ‘to stay’
fico = ‘I stay’, ‘I remain’: fico aqui = ‘I am staying here’
quanto tempo? = how much time? = ‘how long?’
quantos? = ‘how many?’: Quantos dias fica / ficas aqui? = ‘How many days
are you staying here?’
uns (plural of um = ‘a / one’, for masculine things) = ‘a few’, ‘some’
umas (plural of uma = ‘a / one’, for feminine things) = ‘a few’, ‘some’
ficamos uns dias = ‘we are staying a few days’; vamos ficar umas horas =
‘we are going to stay a few hours’
fique = ‘stay’: fique uns dias! = ‘stay a few days!’

CD7 Track 2
In Portuguese, you often use the present tense to indicate the future. ‘I call
you (ring you) tomorrow’ is correct Portuguese, whereas in English you
would say ‘I’ll call you tomorrow’. But if you use the present tense to mean
the future, you need to add some time indication, like mais tarde = ‘later’;
amanhã = ‘tomorrow’, to show that it is the future.
You can also use the ‘to be going to’ form to express the future, which in
Portuguese is made up of the verb ir (= ‘to go’) in the present tense + the
‘to’ form of the verb: vou ligar-te esta noite =‘I am going to call you this
evening’.
Another way to convey the future in English is by using ‘will’. To make this
form in Portuguese, you take the whole verb (the ‘to’ form / the infinitive)
and add the ending -ei for ‘I’ and -emos for ‘we’.
In the future tense in Portuguese you hit the ending.
falar: falarei = ‘I will speak’
comer: comerei = ‘I will sell’
começar: começaremos = ‘we will start’ (pronunciation: stress the re)
partir: partiremos = ‘we will leave’
CD7 Track 3
esperar = ‘to wait’, ‘to hope’; espero = ‘I hope / wait’; esperarei = ‘I will
hope / wait’; esperaremos= ‘we will hope / wait’
ficarei = ‘I will stay’
In the future tense in Portuguese, when you add a pronoun (like ‘it’, ‘him’,
‘her’, ‘you’) to the phrase, you end up with a ‘sandwich’, because you have
to put the pronoun between the verb and the ending: comprá-lo-ei = ‘I will
buy it’. One way to avoid this difficult mouthful is by using the ‘going to’
future instead: vou comprá-lo = ‘I am going to buy it’; vais ligar-me = ‘you
are going to call me’ (addressing Roberto / Roberta).
CD7 Track 4
The remaining endings of the future tense (with ‘will’) are: -ás for ‘you
(informal)’; -á for ‘you (formal) / he / she / it’ and -ão for ‘you all’ and ‘they’.

MTM Foundation Portuguese

comprarás = ‘you will buy’ (addressing Roberto / Roberta); comprará =
‘you will buy’; comprarão = ‘you all / they will buy’
CD7 Track 5
demasiado = ‘too much’: é demasiado caro = ‘it is too expensive’
The endings of the future tense in Portuguese are the same for all verbs.
Estarei aqui umas horas = ‘I will be here a few hours’.
CD7 Track 6
será = ‘it will be’
irei = ‘I will go’
CD7 Track 7
The -zer verbs (ço-go verbs in the present tense) go their own way in the
future. For these verbs you don’t use the whole verb, rather you drop the
-zer and add -rei, -rás -rá; -remos, -rão.
fazer: farei = ‘I will do’; fará = ‘you (formal) he / she / it will do’; farás =
‘you (informal) will do’; faremos = ‘we will do’; farão= ‘you all / they will
do’
dizer: direi = ‘I will say’; dirá = ‘you (formal) he / she / it will say’; dirás =
‘you (informal) will say’; diremos = ‘we will say’; dirão= ‘you all / they will
say’
trazer: trarei = ‘I will bring’; trará = ‘you (formal) he / she / it will bring’;
trarás = ‘you (informal) will bring’; traremos = ‘we will bring’; trarão= ‘you
all / they will bring’
CD7 Track 8
Double negative
nada = ‘nothing’; não traremos nada = ‘we will not bring nothing = we will
not bring anything’

CD7 Track 9
What applies for the future tense (with ‘will’) applies to ‘would’, the
conditional. The endings in Portuguese are -ria, -rias, -ria, -ríamos, -riam.
seria necessário = ‘it would be necessary’
faria = ‘I would do’
The ‘sandwich’ also applies: fá-lo-ia = ‘I would do it’
CD7 Track 10
ter: terei = ‘I will have’; terá = ‘he / she / it / you will have’; teria = ‘I / he /
she / it / you would have’
Two ways of saying ‘I would like’: gostaria de = ‘I would like (of)’: gostaria
de vê-lo = ‘I would like to see it’; queria = I wanted = ‘I would like’: queria
vê-lo = ‘I would like to see it’
CD7 Track 11
The past tense (to express something that happened once and is finished):
for ‘I’ in the past we hit the ending: ‘past is last’. Take off the -ar / -er / -ir
and add the ending -ei on the -ar track and -i on the -er and -ir tracks:
comprar: comprei = ‘I bought / have bought’; vender: vendi = ‘I sold / have
sold’; partir: parti = ‘I left / have left’.
For ‘you (formal) / he / she / it’ you hit the ending again. Take off the -ar /
-er / -ir and add the ending -ou on the -ar track, -eu on the -er track and -iu
on the -ir track: ele comprou = ‘he bought / has bought’; ele vendeu = ‘he
sold / has sold’; ele partiu ‘he left / has left’.
ontem = ‘yesterday’
CD7 Track 12
For ‘we’ in the past tense just replace the -r of the whole verb ending with
-mos, which makes the past tense for ‘we’ sound the same as the present.
CD8 Track 1
For ‘you all’ and ‘they’ in the past tense you just add -am to the whole verb:
compraram, venderam, partiram.

MTM Foundation Portuguese

5/6/08

10:28 am

Page 31

For ‘you’ (addressing Roberto / Roberta = tu form) in the past tense you
use the s of the verb ending of the present tense and the te meaning ‘you’
and combine them in the ending -ste which you add to the whole verb after
taking off the -r: compraste, vendeste, partiste.
CD8 Track 2
Practice with the past tense
CD8 Track 3
Sim, gostei. = ‘Yes, I liked it.’ In Portuguese, the ‘it’ is omitted.
CD8 Track 4
esperar = ‘to wait’, ‘to hope’. In Portuguese you don’t need to say ‘for’:
espero-o = ‘I am awaiting you = I am waiting for you’ ; espera-o = ‘he is
waiting for you’; esperam-me = ‘they are waiting for me’
CD8 Track 5
esperemos! = ‘let’s wait!’; comamos! = ‘let’s eat!’
CD8 Track 6
perguntar = ‘to ask’: gostaria de perguntar = ‘I would like to ask’;
perguntar-lhe = ‘to ask you’; dizer-lhe = ‘to tell you’
para = ‘for’, ‘in order to’: para perguntar = ‘in order to ask’; para lhe
perguntar / para perguntar-lhe = ‘to ask you / him / her’
CD8 Track 7
chegar: chega = ‘you (formal) / he / she / it arrives’; cheguei = ‘I arrived’
acabar de = ‘to finish (of)’: acabo de chegar / acabei de chegar = ‘I have
just arrived’
acabo de chegar aqui há uns dias = ‘I just arrived here a few days ago’

Differences between Brazilian and European Portuguese
Differences in pronunciation of vowels: vowels sound more open in
Brazilian Portuguese
Differences in pronunciation of consonants: the final l and s, the s before a
t; d and t before an e and i, the initial r
Differences in usage of pronouns
The equivalent in usage to the informal ‘you’ in Brazil is você. (The tu form
is used to address God.)
European Portuguese: não te compreendo; a que horas te levantas?
Brazilian Portuguese: não compreendo você; a que horas você se levanta?
Differences when expressing the continuous tense (‘to be in the process of
doing’): European Portuguese: estou a escrever; Brazilian Portuguese:
estou escrevendo
Differences in vocabulary: botar for pôr, todo o mundo for toda a gente

In the Review courses you will hear only the voice of the teacher giving the English prompts and
the foreign language responses. As there are no students, there is no teaching of the language
structures, and so these courses are ideal for the learner at home to check for areas causing
difficulty and to revisit the relevant teaching point in the Foundation or Advanced course.
