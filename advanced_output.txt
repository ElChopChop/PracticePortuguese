Introduction
What is the Michel Thomas Method?
The Michel Thomas Method* all-audio courses, published by Hodder
Education, provide an accelerated method for language learning that is truly
revolutionary. And they promise a remarkable educational experience that
will make your learning both exciting and pleasurable.

How does the Method work?
The Method works by breaking a language down into its component parts,
enabling learners to reconstruct the language themselves – to form their
own sentences, to say what they want, when they want. Because you learn
the language in small steps, you can build it up yourself to produce ever
more complicated sentences.

The Michel Thomas Method is ‘in tune’ with the way your brain works, so
you assimilate the language easily and don’t forget it! The Method teaches
you through your own language, so there’s no stress, and no anxiety. The
teacher builds up the new language, step by step, and you don’t move on till
you’ve absorbed and understood the previous point. As Michel Thomas said,
‘What you understand, you know, and what you know, you don’t forget.’
With parallels to the way you learnt your own language, each language is
learnt in ‘real-time’ conditions. There is no need to stop for homework,
additional exercises or vocabulary memorization.

‘Learning Spanish with Michel was the most
extraordinary learning experience of my life –
it was unforgettable.’
Emma Thompson

‘Michel Thomas is a precious find indeed.’
The Guardian
The classroom situation on the recording lets you learn with others. You enjoy
their success, and you learn from their mistakes. The students on the
recordings are not reading from scripts and they have received no additional
instruction or preparation – just the guidance you hear on the recording. You,
as the learner, become the third student and participate actively in the class.
A very important part of the Michel Thomas Method is that full responsibility
for your learning lies with the teacher, not with you, the pupil. This helps to
ensure that you can relax, and feel confident, so allowing you to learn
effectively.
You will enjoy the Method as it creates real excitement – you can’t wait to
use the language.

‘There’s no such thing as a poor student,
only a poor teacher.’
Michel Thomas

What level of language will I achieve?
The Introductory and Foundation courses are designed for complete
beginners. They make no assumption of a knowledge of any language other
than English. They will give the beginner a practical and functional use of the

HOW ARE THE RECORDINGS BEST USED?
• Relax! Make yourself comfortable before playing the recording and try to let
go of the tensions and anxieties traditionally associated with learning.
• Do not write or take any notes. Remove notebooks, pens, dictionaries
and anything else associated with learning at school.
• Do not try to remember. While participating in the recording and
afterwards, it is important that you do not try to memorize specific words or
expressions. It is a basic principle of the Michel Thomas Method that the
responsibility for the student’s learning lies with the teacher. With the Michel
Thomas Method as your teacher, your learning will be based on understanding,
and what you understand you don’t forget.
• Interact fully with the recordings. Use the pause button and respond out
loud (or in a whisper, or in your head, if you are in a public place) before the
students’ responses. This is essential. You do not learn by repetition but by
thinking out the answers to each question; it is by your own thought process
that you truly learn.
• Give yourself time to think. The students on the recordings had all the time
they needed to think out their responses. On the recordings their ‘thinking time’
has been cut in order to make full use of the recording time. You can take all the
time you need (by using your pause button). The pause button is the key to your
learning! To get you used to pausing the recording before the students’ responses,
bleeps have been added to the first few tracks. When you hear the bleep, pause
the recording, think out and say your response, then release the pause button to
hear the student’s, then the teacher’s, response.
• Start at the beginning of the course. Whatever your existing knowledge
of the language you are learning, it is important that you follow the way that the
teacher builds up your knowledge of the language.
• Do not get annoyed with yourself if you make a mistake. Mistakes are
part of the learning process; as long as you understand why you made the
mistake and you have the ‘ahaa’ reaction – ‘yes, of course, I understand now’ –
you are doing fine. If you made a mistake and you do not understand why, you
may have been daydreaming for a few seconds. The course is structured so that
you cannot go on unless you fully understand everything, so just go back a little
and you will pick up where you left off.
• Stop the recording whenever it suits you. You will notice that this course
is not divided into lessons; you will always be able to pick up from where you
left off, without the need to review.

spoken language. They are also appropriate for anyone who has studied a
language before, but has forgotten much of it or does not have confidence
in speaking.
The Introductory course comprises the first two hours of the Foundation
Course. The Advanced course follows on from the Foundation course and
expands on structures touched on in the earlier course to improve your
understanding and mastery of complex language.
The Michel Thomas Method teaches the everyday conversational language
that will allow you to communicate in a wide variety of situations, empowered
by the ability to create your own sentences and use the language naturally.
You will absorb the vocabulary and grammatical structures and, in addition,
will be introduced to elements of writing and reading.

Who is the Michel Thomas Method for?
Anyone can learn a language with the Michel Thomas Method – and the
wide diversity of Michel Thomas’s own students proves this. Not only did
Michel instruct the rich and famous, but he also taught many so-called
‘hopeless cases’. For example, in 1997, Michel taught French to a group of
sixteen-year-olds in north London who had been told they could never
learn a language, and gave them the ability to use the new language far
beyond their expectations – in just a week. Perhaps more importantly, he
gave them the confidence to speak and a belief in, and the experience of,
their own ability to learn.
Whatever your motivation for learning a language, the Michel Thomas
Method quite simply offers the most effective method that is available.

How quickly can I learn with the Michel Thomas Method?

What can I do next?

One of the most remarkable features of the Michel Thomas Method is the
speed with which results are achieved. A knowledge of the language that will
take months of conventional study can be achieved in a matter of hours with
the Michel Thomas Method. The teacher masterfully guides the student
through an instructional process at a very rapid rate – yet the process will
appear informal, relaxed and unhurried. The teacher moves quickly between
numerous practice sessions, which all build the learners’ confidence in their
ability to communicate in complex ways.

Try to speak with native speakers whenever possible, as this is invaluable for
improving your fluency. Magazines, newspapers and podcasts (especially
those which feature interviews) will give you practice in the most current
and idiomatic language. Expose yourself to the language whenever you can
– you will have firm foundations on which to build.

Because the Michel Thomas Method is based on understanding, not
memorization, there is no set limit to the length of time that you should study
the course. It offers immersion without strain or stress, and you will find the
recordings are not divided into lessons, though the material has been indexed
for your convenience. This means that you can stop and start as you please.
The excitement of learning will motivate you to continue listening and
learning for as long a time as is practical for you. This will enable you to make
progress faster than you ever imagined possible.

Build your vocabulary with the Vocabulary courses, which carry forward the
Michel Thomas Method teaching tradition and faithfully follow Michel
Thomas’s unique approach to foreign language learning. The series editor is
Dr Rose Lee Hayden, Michel’s most experienced and trusted teacher. The
courses remain faithful to the method Michel Thomas used in his earlier
courses, with the all-audio and ‘building-block’ approach. The teacher builds
on Michel’s foundations to encourage the student at home to build up their
vocabulary in the foreign language, using relationships with English, where
appropriate, or connections within the foreign language itself. The student
takes part in the audio, following prompts by the teacher, as in Michel
Thomas’s original Foundation and Advanced courses.

Track listing
CD1 Track 1
Introduction
Review of the present tense. Pronunciation: the ‘o‘ in comprar (‘to buy‘) is
a nasal sound because of the ‘m‘ that follows. In porque é the final ‘e‘ of
porque is pronounced like an ‘ee‘ because it runs into the é that follows.
‘the car‘ = o carro; ‘a car‘ = um carro; pronunciation of the ‘rr‘ (carro).
CD1 Track 2
‘well‘ = bem: ‘Paulo speaks Portuguese well‘ = o Paulo fala bem português
(literally: ‘the Paulo speaks well Portuguese‘).
Pronunciation: in todos os dias (‘all the days‘ = ‘every day‘) the final ‘s‘ of
todos runs into the ‘o‘ of os and sounds like a ‘z‘, because an ‘s‘ between
two vowels sounds ‘z‘.
CD1 Track 3
After verb forms ending in ‘m‘, o and a (‘it‘) change to -no / -na: ‘they are
selling it‘ = vendem-no (masculine thing), vendem-na (feminine thing);
‘they are buying it‘ = compram-nos (plural masculine things), compramnas (plural feminine things).
CD1 Track 4
Some verbs, instead of ending in -o (pronounced ‘oo‘) in the present tense
‘I‘ form, end in -ou (pronounced ‘ohw‘).
‘to be‘ = estar; ser. Difference between ser and estar: estar indicates a
temporary state, ser indicates something more permanent, e.g. a Maria é
bonita (‘Maria is a pretty girl‘); a Maria está bonita (‘Maria is especially
pretty today‘).

Page 12

‘I am going‘ = vou: ‘tomorrow‘ = amanhã (ã is a nasal sound because of
the tilde ~); ‘I am going to Lisbon tomorrow‘ = vou a Lisboa amanhã.
‘nothing‘ = nada. In Portuguese, nada is used with a negative verb: não
vou comprar nada aqui (literally: ‘I‘m not going to buy nothing here‘).
‘I am sorry, but I don‘t know what it is‘ = lamento, mas não sei o que é.
CD1 Track 5
When referring to the fixed location of, for instance, a building or a city, the
verb used in Portuguese is ficar; but to indicate indicate a temporary state
or location the verb used is estar: ‘where is it?‘ = onde está?; (addressing o
senhor / a senhora) ‘how are you?‘ = como está? Estar is also used to
express that an action that is going on right now: ‘he is speaking‘ (at this
very moment) = ele está a falar (literally: ‘he is at to speak‘).
‘something‘ = algo; ‘he is (right now) preparing something for me‘ = está
a preparar algo para mim. ‘to prepare it‘ = prepará-lo / prepará-la. When
you hook ‘it‘ on to the full form of the verb (the infinitive), ‘it‘ changes to
‘-lo‘ (masculine thing) / ‘-la‘ (feminine thing), and the ‘r‘ of the infinitive
falls away.
CD1 Track 6
‘to do / make‘ = fazer; ‘he does / makes‘ = faz; ‘you do‘ (Roberto) = fazes;
‘they / you (all) make‘ = fazem; ‘to say / tell‘ = dizer; ‘he / she / it says‘ = diz.
CD1 Track 7
lhe = ‘to you‘ (o senhor / a senhora)‘ and also ‘to him / to her‘:
(addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘why don‘t you tell him where it is?‘
= porque não lhe diz onde está?
‘to want‘ = querer; ‘I want‘ = quero; ‘you want / he / she / it wants‘ = quer;
‘he wants it‘ = quere-o / quere-a; ‘so / like that‘ = assim; (addressing o

senhor / a senhora) ‘why do you want it that way?‘ = porque o quer
assim?; ‘they / you (all) want‘ = querem; (addressing Roberto) ‘you want‘ =
queres; ‘when do you want to buy it?‘ = quando queres comprá-lo?
CD1 Track 8
‘you (o senhor / a senhora) go / he / she / it goes / are / is going‘ = vai;
(addressing Roberto) ‘you go / are going‘ = vais.
In Portuguese many prepositions (like ‘to‘, ‘in‘, ‘of‘) contract with o and a (=
‘the‘): ‘to the‘ = a + o = ao (masculine form); a + a = à (feminine form); a
+ os / as = aos / às; de + o = do (masculine); de + a = da (feminine).
‘to see‘ = ver; ‘tonight‘ = esta noite (literally: ‘this night‘); ‘they are going to
see it tonight‘ = vão vê-lo esta noite; ‘and‘ = e; ‘and they are going to buy it
tomorrow‘ = e vão comprá-lo amanhã; ‘later‘ = mais tarde (literally: ‘more
late‘): (addressing a group) ‘are you going to see it later?‘ = vão vê-lo mais
tarde?
CD1 Track 9
‘to have‘ = ter; ‘I have it for you (o senhor)‘ = tenho-o para o senhor; ‘you
have (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it has‘ = tem; ‘he has it‘ = tem-no;
‘she doesn‘t have it‘ = não o tem; (addressing Roberto) ‘you have‘ = tens
(in Portuguese you cannot have an ‘m‘ and a ‘s‘ together so they become
‘ns‘); ‘to have to‘ = ter de (literally: ‘to have of‘); (addressing Roberto) ‘you
have to be here later‘ = tens de estar aqui mais tarde; ‘you (all) / they
have‘ = têm; ‘they have to have it tomorrow‘ = têm de tê-lo amanhã.
‘to come‘ = vir; ‘they want to come to Lisbon‘ = querem vir a Lisboa; ‘I
come‘ = venho; ‘you come (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it comes‘
= vem.
‘a week‘ = uma semana; ‘the week‘ = a semana; ‘next week‘ = a semana
que vem (literally: ‘the week that comes‘); ‘in the‘ = em + o = no

13

MTM Advanced Portuguese:PORTUGUESE

Page 14

(masculine); em + a = na (feminine); ‘he comes to Lisbon next week‘ = ele
vem a Lisboa na semana que vem (literally: ‘he comes to Lisbon in the
week that comes‘); ‘the year‘ = o ano; ‘next year‘ = o ano que vem; ‘he
comes to Lisbon next year‘ = vem a Lisboa no ano que vem; ‘you (all) /
they come‘ = vêm; ‘they come / are coming to Portugal next year‘ = vêm a
Portugal no ano que vem.
‘to start‘ = começar; (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘why don‘t you
start?‘ = porque é que não começa?; (addressing a group) ‘why don‘t you
start?‘ = porque é que não começam?; ‘I start now‘ = começo agora;
(addressing Roberto) ‘why don‘t you start?‘ = porque é que não começas?
CD1 Track 10
‘we start‘ = começamos; ‘we have‘ = temos; ‘we come‘ = vimos; ‘we go‘ =
vamos; ‘let‘s go!‘ = vamos! When the ‘we‘ form of the verb is followed by
the pronouns ‘it‘ or ‘them‘ the ‘s‘ of -mos is dropped and an ‘l‘ is added to
the pronoun: ‘we buy it‘ = compramo-lo / compramo-la.
‘to lift‘ = levantar; ‘myself‘ = me; ‘I lift myself up‘ = ‘I get up‘ = levanto-me;
(addressing Roberto) ‘you / yourself‘ = te; ‘you get up‘ = levantas-te; ‘at
what time do you get up?‘ = a que horas te levantas?; ‘I understand you‘ =
compreendo-te.
se = ‘oneself / himself / herself / itself / yourself (o senhor / a senhora) /
themselves / yourselves‘: ‘to get up‘ = levantar-se (literally: ‘to lift oneself
up‘); ‘he gets (himself) up‘ = levanta-se; ‘us / ourselves‘ = nos ; ‘we get up
late‘ = levantamo-nos tarde. (The ‘s‘ of ‘-mos‘ is dropped because of the
‘nos‘ that follows.)
‘we‘ = nós (used for emphasis): ‘we don‘t want it‘ = nós não o queremos.
‘with me‘ = comigo; ‘with you‘ (Roberto) = contigo; ‘with us‘ = connosco;
‘she comes / she’s coming with us tomorrow‘ = ela vem connosco
amanhã. Pronunciation: the ‘s‘ of connosco sounds like ‘sh‘.

CD2 Track 1
The key sounds for the present tense are: a on the -ar track and e on the
other tracks. If you switch tracks (from a to e and e to a), you are in the
command tense (the imperative): (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘buy
the house!‘ = compre a casa!; ‘don‘t buy it (a masculine / feminine thing)!‘
= não o compre! / não a compre!; (addressing a group) ‘don‘t buy it!‘ =
não o comprem!
In the positive command to Roberto (‘tu‘ form), you do not switch tracks;
you just drop the ‘s‘: ‘buy the house!‘ = compra a casa! In the negative
command, though, you do switch tracks and you keep the ‘s‘: ‘don‘t buy it!‘
= não o compres! / não a compres!
‘to call‘ (on the phone) = ligar; (addressing Roberto) ‘ring me tomorrow‘ =
liga-me amanhã; (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘ring me tomorrow‘ =
ligue-me amanhã; (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘don‘t ring me today‘
= não me ligue hoje; (addressing Roberto) ‘don‘t ring me today‘ = não me
ligues hoje.
‘to bring‘ = trazer; ‘I bring‘ = trago; ‘you (all) bring‘ = trazem; ‘you (o
senhor / a senhora) bring / he / she / it brings‘ = traz. Pronunciation: a ‘z‘
at the end of a word sounds like a ‘sh‘ but otherwise is pronounced ‘z‘.
(addressing Roberto) ‘you bring‘ = trazes; ‘are you bringing something for
me?‘ = trazes algo para mim?
‘to do / make‘ = fazer; ‘I do / make‘ = faço; (addressing o senhor / a
senhora) ‘what are you doing?‘ = o que faz?
CD2 Track 2
In the command tense the ‘ço-go‘ verbs turn into ‘ça-ga‘: (addressing o
senhor / a senhora) ‘do it now! ‘ = faça-o agora!; ‘tell him that I am
bringing it‘ = diga-lhe que o trago; (talking to a group) ‘bring it now!‘ =
tragam-no agora!; (addressing Roberto) ‘don‘t do it now!‘ = não o faças
agora!; ‘don‘t tell me anything now!‘ = não me digas nada agora!
‘to know‘ = saber; (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘do you know it?‘ =

15

MTM Advanced Portuguese:PORTUGUESE

16

9/12/08

12:04

Page 16

sabe-o! (addressing Roberto) ‘you know‘ = sabes; ‘do you know it?‘ = sabelo? As happens in the ‘we‘ form, with the Roberto form the ‘s‘ is dropped
before ‘it‘ and the ‘it‘ becomes -lo / -la.
CD2 Track 3
‘all‘ (from ‘every day‘ / ‘all the days‘) = todo; ‘everything‘ = tudo; ‘they know
everything‘ = sabem tudo; ‘we know everything‘ = nós sabemos tudo; ‘we
know it‘ = sabemo-lo; ‘I know‘ = sei; ‘I know nothing‘ = não sei nada.
In Portuguese, there are two verbs for ‘to know‘. One is for knowledge of a
fact (saber); the other is for acquaintance with a person or place
(conhecer): ‘to know‘ (a person) = conhecer; ‘I know‘ = conheço; ‘I don‘t
know him / her‘ = não o / a conheço.

‘at home‘ = em casa (literally: ‘in house‘); ‘to stay‘ = ficar; ‘my friends are
staying a week‘ (female friends) = as minhas amigas ficam uma semana.
‘my‘ describing a masculine thing or person = o meu (‘the my‘); ‘my friend‘
(referring to a male friend) = o meu amigo; ‘my friends‘ (referring to a
mixed group of friends or more than one male friend) = os meus amigos;
‘my friends are not at home today‘ = os meus amigos não estão em casa
hoje.
CD2 Track 5
‘your‘ (o senhor / a senhora) / ‘his‘ / ‘her‘ / ‘your‘ (as a group) / ‘their‘ (for
a masculine thing) = o seu. The feminine form is a sua.
CD2 Track 6

CD2 Track 4
The ‘-nho‘ verbs (‘I come‘ = venho; ‘I have‘ = tenho; ‘I put‘ = ponho) turn in
to ‘-nha‘ in the command form: (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘come
with me tomorrow!‘ = venha comigo amanhã!
‘to put‘ = pôr; (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘put it here!‘ = ponha-o
aqui!; ‘don‘t put it here!‘ = não o ponha aqui! Pronunciation: the end of
ponha runs into aqui.
You can avoid the command tense by using ‘can you?‘ = pode? (from poder
= ‘to be able to‘): (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘can you have it ready
for me tomorrow?‘ = pode tê-lo pronto para mim amanhã?

‘until‘ = até; ‘until tomorrow‘ = até amanhã (as a farewell, it is equivalent to
‘see you tomorrow‘); ‘her friend is busy until tomorrow‘ (female friend) = a
sua amiga está ocupada até amanhã; ‘until next week‘ = até à semana
que vem; ‘her friends are staying in Lisbon until next week‘ (several female
friends) = as suas amigas ficam em Lisboa até à semana que vem.
If you need a clarifier for ‘his / her / its‘ you use the forms dele / dela (‘of
he‘ / ‘of she‘ / ‘of it‘); ‘her friend‘ (‘the (male) friend of she‘) = o amigo
dela. For ‘their‘ you just add an ‘s‘ to dele / dela: ‘their friends‘ (‘the (male)
friends of them (males)‘) = os amigos deles.

‘I can‘ = posso.

CD2 Track 7

‘I am English‘ = sou inglês (masculine), sou inglesa (feminine). In
Portuguese, the words for ‘my‘, ‘your‘, etc., also change to agree with the
person or thing they are describing, like inglês / inglesa, and you add ‘the‘
in front of them: ‘my‘ (one feminine thing or female person) = a minha;
‘my house‘ = a minha casa (literally: ‘the my house‘). The plural is
formed by adding ‘s‘: ‘my friends‘ (more than one female friend)
= as minhas amigas.

‘your‘ (Roberto, informal you) = o teu / a tua: ‘where is your house?‘ =
onde fica a tua casa?; ‘your friend knows everything‘ (female friend) = a
tua amiga sabe tudo; ‘yes, we know your friends‘ (mixed group of friends)
= sim, conheçemos os teus amigos.
‘to go out‘ = sair; ‘I am leaving / I leave‘ = saio; ‘you leave / are leaving
(o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it leaves / is leaving‘ = sai.

Page 18

‘you put‘ (o senhor / a senhora), ‘he / she / it puts‘ = põe. Pronunciation:
the tilde (~) always indicates that it is a nasal sound; (addressing Roberto)
‘you put / are putting‘ = pões; ‘why don‘t you put it here?‘ = porque que é
que não o pões aqui?; ‘you (all) put / are putting‘; ‘they put / are putting‘ =
põem; ‘where are you putting it?‘ = onde o põem?
CD2 Track 8
For the positive command to Roberto in the ‘-nho‘ and ‘ço-go‘ verbs you
use the ordinary (not command) form for ‘you / he / she / it‘: ‘tell me now!‘
(addressing Roberto) = diz-me agora! (pronunciation: here the ‘z‘ of diz
sounds like ‘s‘ of ‘measure‘ because it is followed by an ‘m‘); ‘come with
me!‘ = vem comigo!; ‘have it with you!‘ = tem-no contigo!; ‘put it here!‘ =
põe-no aqui! (here, the ‘it‘ becomes ‘-no‘ because of the nasal sound that
precedes); ‘don‘t come!‘ = não venhas!; ‘come!‘ = vem!; ‘don‘t put it here!‘
= não o ponhas aqui!
CD2 Track 9
There are three ways of indicating the future in Portuguese: one is to use
the ordinary present tense (‘my friend calls you later‘ = a minha amiga
liga-lhe mais tarde) together with a future time reference (e.g. ‘later‘,
‘tomorrow‘), another is to use ‘going to‘ (‘my friend is going to call you
later‘ = a minha amiga vai ligar-lhe mais tarde), and the third is to go to
the whole verb (infinitive form) and hit the ending ‘r‘ with -ei, -ás, -á,
-emos, -ão.
‘to speak‘ = falar; ‘I will speak‘ = falarei; ‘to eat‘ = comer; ‘they will eat‘ =
comerão; ‘to depart / leave‘ = partir; ‘we will leave tomorrow‘ = partiremos
amanhã; ‘to come‘ = vir; ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) he / she / it will
come‘ = virá; (addressing Roberto) ‘you will come‘ = virás.
‘home / towards home‘ (as in ‘come home‘) = para casa; ‘he will come
home later‘ = virá para casa mais tarde.
In writing you‘ll see a ‘pronoun sandwich‘ when you put the pronoun after
the verb with the future tense: ‘I will buy it’ = comprar + it + ei (ending for

future) = comprá-lo-ei; ‘I will sell it‘ = vendê-lo-ei. In spoken Portuguese
these forms are avoided and what you hear is the ‘going to‘ form: vou
vendê-lo.
For the ‘ço-go‘ verbs (fazer, dizer and trazer) in the future you do not use
the whole verb; rather you drop the ‘-zer‘ and add -rei, -rás, -rá; -remos,
-rão to what is left: ‘to do‘ = fazer; ‘I will do‘ = farei; (addressing Roberto)
‘you will do‘ = farás; ‘we will do‘ = faremos; ‘to tell‘ = dizer; ‘I will tell‘ =
direi; ‘he will tell‘ = dirá; ‘what will your friends say to him?‘ (‘your‘ = do
senhor / da senhora) = o que lhe dirão os seus amigos? (literally: ‘what to
him will say your friends?‘).
‘it is necessary‘ = é necessário; ‘it will be necessary‘ = será necessário; ‘it
will be necessary to do it this way‘ = será necessário fazê-lo assim; ‘to have‘
= ter; ‘they will have‘ = terão.
‘for next week‘ = para a semana que vem; ‘they won‘t have it ready for
next week‘ = não o terão pronto para a semana que vem.
‘to hope‘ / ‘to wait‘ = esperar; (addressing Roberto) ‘I will wait for your
friends here‘ = esperarei os teus amigos aqui.
CD2 Track 10
For ‘would‘, the conditional, ‘I would buy‘, you hit the ‘r‘ ending of the
infinitive with -ia, -ias, -ia, -íamos, -iam: ‘it would be necessary‘ = seria
necessário; ‘it wouldn‘t be possible that way‘ = não seria possível assim.
The ‘woulds‘ for the ‘ço-go‘ verbs are formed in the same way as for the
future, from fa-, di- and tra-: ‘I would do the translation today, but I don‘t
have time‘ = faria a tradução hoje, mas não tenho tempo.
With the conditional in Portuguese, there‘s the same pronoun sandwich as
for the future tense: ‘I would do it‘ = fá-lo-ia.
‘to like‘ = gostar de (literally: ‘to like of‘); ‘this‘ (in general) = isto; ‘I like to
do this‘ = gosto de fazer isto; disto = de + isto (‘of this‘): (addressing a
group) ‘do you like this?‘ = gostam disto?; ‘would you like this?‘ =
gostariam disto?

CD2 Track 11
For the past, we take off the ‘-ar‘ / ‘-er‘ / ‘-ir‘ and, for ‘I‘, hit the endings -ei
(-ar track) or -i (not -ar track). For ‘he‘, ‘she‘, ‘it‘ or ‘you‘ (o senhor / a
senhora) hit the endings -ou for ‘-ar‘ verbs, -eu for ‘-er‘ verbs and -iu for ‘-ir‘
verbs: ‘I bought / have bought‘ = comprei. ‘yesterday‘ = ontem; ‘I bought it
yesterday‘ = comprei-o ontem; (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘when

For ‘you all‘ and ‘they‘ in the past you add -am to the whole verb:
compraram, venderam, partiram: ‘they sold it‘ = venderam-no; ‘why did
they leave? / why have they left?‘ = porque partiram?
For the past for ‘you‘ Roberto you add -aste, -este, -iste to the whole verb
after taking off the ‘-r‘: compraste, vendeste, partiste: (addressing Roberto)
‘why did you sell it? ‘ = porque o vendeste?; ‘when did you leave?‘ =
quando partiste?
CD2 Track 12
‘to lose‘ = perder; ‘I have lost‘ = perdi; ‘I have lost it‘ = perdi-o; (addressing

(addressing Roberto) ‘when did you lose it?‘ = quando o perdeste?

‘yet‘ / ‘still‘ = ainda ; ‘not yet‘ = ainda não; ‘my friends have not arrived yet‘
= os meus amigos ainda não chegaram (literally: ‘the my friends still not

desculpem!; desculpem-me!
‘that‘ (in general) = isso; ‘I want that!‘ = quero isso!; ‘that book‘ = esse livro;

‘these days / nowadays‘ = nestes dias; ‘nowadays we like to stay at home‘ =
nestes dias gostamos de ficar em casa.

‘I am‘ = sou, ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) are / he / she / it is‘ = é, ‘you
(Roberto) are‘ = és, ‘we are‘ = somos, ‘you (all) / they are‘ = são;
(addressing Roberto) ‘are you from London?‘ (literally: ‘are you of
London?‘) = és de Londres?; ‘where are you from? = de onde és? (literally:
‘from where are you?‘). Pronunciation: the ‘e‘ of de runs into onde and so
sounds like an ‘ee‘.
‘to see‘ = ver; ‘I see‘ = vejo; ‘I see that our friends haven‘t arrived yet‘ = vejo
que os nossos amigos ainda não chegaram; ‘I can‘t see anything‘ = não
vejo nada (literally: ‘I don‘t see nothing‘); ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) see‘ /
‘he / she / it sees‘ = vê; ‘you (all) see‘ = vêem; ‘do you see anything?‘ =
vêem algo? (literally: ‘do you see something?‘); ‘we see‘ = vemos; ‘we see
everything‘ = vemos tudo.

CD3 Track 5
‘I put‘ = ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it put‘ = pôs: ‘there‘ = ali;
‘I didn‘t put it there‘ = não o pus ali; ‘where did you put it (Roberto)?‘ =
onde o puseste?; ‘we put it here‘ = pusemo-lo aqui; ‘they / you (all) put‘ =
puseram; (addressing a group) ‘where did you put everything?‘ = onde
puseram tudo?; ‘he put something here‘ = pôs algo aqui.
‘I wanted‘ = quis; ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it wanted‘ = quis:
‘I didn‘t want it‘ = não o quis; ‘he didn‘t want it‘ = não o quis; ‘what did you
want, Roberto?‘ = o que quiseste, Roberto?; ‘we didn‘t want anything‘ = não
quisemos nada; ‘we wanted it‘ = quisemo-lo; ‘they wanted‘ = quiseram.
Pronunciation: the ‘s‘ of quis sounds like ‘sh‘ but in the other forms, like
quiseste, since it is between two vowels, it is pronounced ‘z‘.
‘I brought‘ = trouxe (pronounced ‘trosh‘); ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he /
she / it brought‘ = trouxe; ‘they brought / have brought‘ = trouxeram; ‘we
didn‘t bring anything‘ = não trouxemos nada.

Roberto?; ‘we were at home‘ = estivemos em casa; (addressing a group)

tive nada para fazer; ‘we didn‘t have anything to do‘ = não tivemos nada
para fazer; ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it was‘ = esteve; ‘you (o
senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it had‘ = teve: ‘he was here‘ = esteve aqui;
‘he had to do something‘ = teve de fazer algo; ‘he was here and had to do

In the past tense, ver (‘to see‘) behaves just like an ‘-ir‘ verb, so it follows
partir: ‘I saw it there‘ = vi-o ali; (addressing a group) ‘what did you see?‘ =
o que viram?; ‘we saw everything‘ = vimos tudo; (addressing Roberto)
‘what did you see?‘ = o que é que viste?; ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he /
she / it saw‘ = viu: ‘he didn‘t see anything‘ = não viu nada.
ser (permanent ‘to be‘) and ir (‘to go‘) are exactly the same in the past
tense: ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it went / was‘ = foi; ‘I went /
was‘ = fui; ‘we went / were‘ = fomos; ‘you all / they went / were‘ = foram:
‘why did you go, Roberto?‘ = porque é que foste, Roberto?; ‘we went to
Brazil‘ = fomos ao Brazil; ‘I went home yesterday‘ = fui para casa ontem;
‘the document was prepared‘ = o documento foi preparado.
‘I came‘ = vim; ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it came‘ = veio;
‘you (Roberto) came‘ = vieste; ‘why did you come yesterday, Roberto?‘ =
porque vieste ontem, Roberto?; ‘they came and they saw it‘ = vieram e
viram-no; ‘I came yesterday‘ = vim ontem.
‘who‘ = quem; (addressing o senhor) ‘who came with you?‘ = quem veio com
o senhor?; (addressing Roberto) ‘who came with you?‘ = quem veio contigo?
CD3 Track 8

(addressing a group) ‘why did you accept it?‘ = porque é que o aceitaram?
‘to leave‘ (something behind) = deixar; ‘I left something for you‘ (o senhor)
= deixei algo para o senhor; ‘message‘ = mensagem; ‘I left a message for
you‘ (o senhor) = deixei uma mensagem para o senhor; ‘I left a message
for you, Roberto‘ = deixei uma mensagem para ti, Roberto.
‘to spend time‘ = passar tempo; ‘we didn‘t spend a lot of time in their
house‘ = não passámos muito tempo na sua casa.
acabar de = ‘to have just done something‘, ‘to finish‘: ‘I have just spent two
days with him‘ = acabo de passar dois dias com ele; ‘we have just gone
out / left‘ = acabamos de sair / partir; ‘he finished‘ = acabou; ‘he finished
eating and left home‘ = acabou de comer e saiu de casa.

CD3 Track 9
‘I was waiting‘, ‘you were waiting‘ etc. express a continuous action in the
past. Because ‘-ing‘ is preceded by ‘was‘ or ‘were‘, Michel Thomas called it
the ‘w-ing‘ tense. In Portuguese, to express ‘was / were + -ing‘ you use the
endings -ava, -avas, -ávamos, -avam on the ‘-ar‘ track: ‘I was waiting‘ =
esperava; (o senhor / a senhora) ‘you were preparing it‘ = preparava-o;
(Roberto) ‘you were preparing it‘ = preparava-lo; ‘they were preparing it‘ =
preparavam-no.
For the the ‘-er‘ and ‘-ir‘ verbs use -ia, -íamos and -iam: ‘I was eating‘ =
comía; ‘I was leaving / going out ‘ = saía.
The ‘ço-go‘ verbs behave normally in this tense: ‘I was doing it‘ = fazia-o;
(addressing Roberto) ‘what were you doing?‘ = o que fazias?; ‘they were
doing something‘ = faziam algo; ‘I was saying‘ = dizia; ‘he was telling me
how to do it‘ = dizia-me como fazê-lo.
CD3 Track 10
‘I wanted‘ = queria; (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘I wanted to know
where you were‘ = queria saber onde estava; ‘I was in Lisbon‘ = estava em
Lisboa; ‘to go‘ = ir; ‘I was going‘ = ia; ‘I was going to buy it‘ = ia comprá-lo;
(addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘where were you going to buy it?’ =
onde ia comprá-lo?; ‘where were you going to buy it, Roberto?’ = onde ias
comprá-lo, Roberto?
‘we used to speak Portuguese with him‘ = falávamos português com ele;
‘they used to speak English‘ = falavam ingles; ‘I was able / could‘ = podia;
‘they spoke English whenever they were able to‘ = falavam inglês quando
podiam.
CD3 Track 11
The w-ing tense (-ava, -ia) expresses a continuous action and can be seen
as a straight line in the past; the other past tense (-ou, -eu, -iu) expresses a
one-off action and so will be referred as the ‘dot‘ past.

‘I wanted‘ = queria; ‘they wanted‘ = queriam; (addressing a group) ‘when
did you want to go out?‘ = quando queriam sair?
‘to live‘ = viver; ‘I used to live‘ = vivia; ‘he used to write to me every day
when he lived in Brazil‘ = escrevia-me todos os dias quando vivia no Brazil;
‘whenever I went to London I would / I used to buy something for my
friend‘ (male friend) = quando ia a Londres comprava algo para o meu
amigo; ‘when I went to London I bought something for my friend‘ (male
friend) = quando foi a Londres comprei algo para o meu amigo.

‘I had‘ / ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it had‘ = tinha; ‘I was
hungry‘ = tinha fome; ‘they had a house in London‘ = tinham uma casa
em Londres.
‘I came‘ / ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it came‘ = vinha; ‘he
came here every year‘ = vinha aqui todos os anos; ‘always‘ = sempre; neste
= em + este (‘of this‘): ‘we would always come to dine in this restaurant‘ =
vínhamos sempre jantar neste restaurante (literally: ‘we came always to
dine in this restaurant‘).
‘I put / used to put‘ = punha; ‘he always used to put his books here‘ =
punha sempre os seus livros aqui.
‘Maria was pretty‘ = a Maria era bonita; ‘so‘ (as in ‘so pretty‘) = tão; ‘Maria
was so pretty‘ = a Maria era tão bonita; ‘Maria was (looking) so pretty
yesterday‘ = a Maria estava tão bonita ontem.

‘last‘ = passado: ‘last year’ = no ano passado (literally: ‘in the year past‘);
‘last week‘ = na semana passada: ‘we had a house in Portugal but we sold
it last year / last week‘ = tínhamos uma casa em Portugal mas vendemo-la
no ano passado / na semana passada.
CD4 Track 3
‘could‘ in English means both ‘would be able‘ and ‘was able‘: ‘I couldn‘t do
it‘ (‘I wasn‘t able to do it‘) = não podia fazê-lo; ‘I couldn‘t do it‘ (‘I would
not be able to do it‘) = não poderia fazê-lo.
‘too‘ (as in ‘too tired‘) = demasiado; ‘I couldn‘t do anything because I was too
tired‘ = não podia fazer nada porque estava demasiado cansado / cansada.
‘to have to‘ / must‘ = dever; ‘I have to‘ / ‘I must‘ / ‘I owe‘ = devo; ‘I must do
it‘ = devo fazê-lo; ‘how much do I owe? ‘ = quanto devo?; ‘I will have to do
it‘ = deverei fazê-lo.
CD4 Track 4
To say, for instance, ‘I had bought‘, you have to ‘dive‘ into the past of
comprar and for ‘had‘ use the ‘w-ing‘ past, tinha. For ‘-ar‘ verbs the diving
past is formed by going to the whole verb, taking off the ‘-ar‘ and replacing
it by -ado: comprar > comprado; preparar > preparado. ‘I had bought‘ =
tinha comprado; ‘I had bought it‘ = tinha comprado-o / tinha-o comprado.
‘to ask‘ = perguntar; ‘he asked me where I had bought it‘ = perguntou-me
onde o tinha comprado.

CD4 Track 2
Because they tend to express a continuous state in the past, rather than a
one-off action, verbs like ‘to know‘, ‘to have‘, ‘to be‘, ‘to want‘ are normally
used in the w-ing tense, rather than the dot past: (addressing o senhor / a
senhora) ‘I didn‘t know that you were going to arrive today‘ = não sabia
que ia chegar hoje; ‘I didn‘t have time‘ = não tinha tempo; ‘I was very busy
yesterday‘ = estava muito ocupado / ocupada ontem; ‘I wanted to do it‘ =
queria fazê-lo; ‘they wanted to buy it‘ = queriam comprá-lo.

CD4 Track 5
The ‘-er‘ / ‘-ir‘ verbs dive into -ido: partir > partido; vender > vendido: ‘he
had already left‘ = já tinha partido: ‘he had sold it‘ = tinha-o vendido /
tinha vendido-o.
‘I would have gone‘ = teria ido; ‘we would have gone with you but it was
late‘ (addressing Roberto) = teríamos ido contigo mas era tarde.

Some verbs do not dive into -ido or -ado: fazer > feito; ver > visto; dizer >
dito; ser > sido; pôr > posto: ‘made in Portugal‘ = feito em Portugal; ‘I had
seen it‘ = tinha-o visto / tinha visto-o; ‘I would have said everything‘ = teria
dito tudo; ‘it would have been possible‘ = teria sido possível; ‘I would have
put‘ = teria posto; ‘to do the shopping‘ = fazer as compras; ‘purchases‘ =
compras; ‘I would have put the shopping here‘ = teria posto as compras
aqui.
‘I would buy‘ = compraria; ‘I would have bought‘ = teria comprado; ‘if‘ =
se: ‘he wanted to know if I would buy his car‘ = queria saber se compraria
o seu carro.
‘to have bought‘ = ter comprado; ‘I could have bought it last year‘ =
poderia tê-lo comprado no ano passado; ‘I would have bought something‘
= teria comprado algo.

(addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘it is important that you ring me‘ = é
importante que me ligue (as que is a joining word, the me comes before
the verb).
(addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘it is not necessary that you leave‘ = não
é necessário que parta; ‘it is not possible that you come with me tomorrow‘
= não é possível que venha comigo amanhã.
In Portuguese, you cannot say ‘I want you to write to me‘; you have to say ‘I
want that you write to me‘: (addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘I want you
to write to me every day‘ = quero que me escreva todos os dias; ‘what do
you want me to write to him?‘ = o que quer que lhe escreva?; (addressing
Roberto) ‘I want you to do it‘ = quero que o faças; (addressing o senhor / a
senhora) ‘why don‘t you want me to tell him everything?‘ = porque não
quer que lhe diga tudo?
CD4 Track 9

CD4 Track 7
‘I should buy it‘ = devia comprá-lo; ‘I should have bought it‘ = devia tê-lo
comprado; ‘I could have bought it‘ = poderia tê-lo comprado; ‘I would have
bought something‘ = teria comprado algo; ‘I could have bought something‘
= poderia ter comprado algo.
‘you should have told me‘ = devia têr-me dito; ‘you could have told me‘
(‘would have been able‘) = poderia ter-me dito / poderia-me ter dito; ‘you
could (were able to) have told me’ = podia ter-me dito / podia-me ter dito.

‘I hope that he comes / will come‘ = espero que venha; ‘we hope that they
will stay at home‘ = esperamos que fiquem em casa; (addressing o senhor
/ a senhora) ‘I hope that you can come‘ = espero que possa vir;
(addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘it is necessary for you to arrive
tomorrow‘ = é necessário que chegue amanhã. If you do not want to be
specific about the person, you can use the full form of the verb: ‘it is
necessary to arrive tomorrow‘ = é necessário chegar amanhã.
CD4 Track 10

CD4 Track 8
The subjunctive is what you use when there is a doubt as to something
happening. The subjunctive is used for the command tense, because when
you give an order you cannot be sure that it‘ll be carried out. The
subjunctive is used a lot more in Portuguese than in English.
(addressing o senhor / a senhora) ‘it‘s important that you buy the book‘ =
é importante que compre o livro (‘you buy‘ is here in the subjunctive).

If you want to avoid the subjunctive and specify the person, you can use
the full form of the verb (infinitive) plus an ending to personalise it (-mos
ending for ‘we‘; -es for ‘you Roberto‘, -em for ‘you all‘ / ‘they‘): ‘it is
necessary for us to arrive tomorrow‘ = é necessário que cheguemos
amanhã (subjunctive) / é necessário chegarmos amanhã (‘personalised‘
infinitive); (addressing Roberto) ‘it is necessary for you to arrive tomorrow‘
= é necessário chegares amanhã; ‘for you to buy this you have to go to
Lisbon‘ = para comprares isto terás de ir a Lisboa; (addressing a group)

‘for you to buy this you will have to go to Lisbon‘ = para comprarem isto
terão de ir a Lisboa.
For ‘I‘ and ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it‘, the form is the same
as the ‘to‘ form (no ending) so you have to add a clarifier: ‘for him to know‘
= para ele saber; ‘I rang him so that he would know where I was‘ = ligueilhe para ele saber onde estava.
‘to find‘ = encontrar: ‘he rang me so that I would / for me to know where to
find it‘ = ligou-me para eu saber onde o encontrar; ‘it is possible that I
arrive tomorrow‘ = é possível eu chegar amanhã (‘personalised‘ infinitive);
é possível que chegue amanhã (subjunctive).
CD4 Track 11
There is a group of verbs that have a different subjunctive form from what
would be expected. They are the verbs that end in -ou for the ‘I‘ form in the
present tense: estou, sou, vou, dou: estar / estou > esteja; ser / sou > seja;
ir / vou > vá; dar / dou > dé. The ‘I‘ and the ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) /
he / she / it‘ forms are the same.
‘it is necessary that you be here‘ (addressing o senhor / a senhora) = é
necessário que esteja aqui; ‘I hope it is possible‘ = espero que seja
possível; ‘do you want me to give him the book?‘ = quer que lhe dê o
livro?; ‘it is necessary that I go to Lisbon‘ = é necessário que vá a Lisboa; ‘it
is necessary that they go home‘ = é necessário que vão para casa; ‘do they
want us to go to Faro tomorrow?‘ = querem que vamos a Faro amanhã?
‘it is possible that I may want it tomorrow‘ = é possível que o queira
amanhã; ‘to mean‘ = querer dizer (literally: ‘to want to say‘); ‘it is important
that you should know what this means‘ = é importante que saiba o que
quer dizer isto.
CD4 Track 12
‘he asked me if I had rung Pedro / Maria‘ = perguntou-me se tinha ligado
ao Pedro / à Maria: here ‘if‘ means ‘whether‘. But when you use ‘if‘ as a

condition in the past, i.e. about something that did not happen, as in ‘if I
had rung you I would have known that you weren‘t coming‘, this ‘had‘ is a
different ‘had‘ – it‘s about something that is in doubt, so we use the
subjunctive. And as it‘s in the past we use the past subjunctive. This is
formed from the ‘they‘ form of the ‘dot‘ past tense: take off the ‘-ram‘ and
replace it with -sse for ‘I‘ and ‘you (o senhor / a senhora) / he / she / it‘,
-sses for ‘you, Roberto‘, -ssemos for the ‘we‘ and -ssem for the ‘they‘ and
‘you all‘: ‘If you had called me last night, and if you had told me that you
were going to arrive today, I would have waited, I would have made a
reservation, we would have dined, we would have gone to see it and it
would have been very good.‘ = Se me tivesse ligado ontem à noite, e se
me tivesse dito que ia chegar hoje, teria esperado, teria feito uma reserva,
teríamos jantado, teríamos ido vê-lo e teria sido muito bom.

In the Review courses you will hear only the voice of the teacher giving the English prompts and
the foreign language responses. As there are no students, there is no teaching of the language
structures, and so these courses are ideal for the learner at home to check for areas causing
difficulty and to revisit the relevant teaching point in the Foundation or Advanced course.
